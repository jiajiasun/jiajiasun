- 👋 Hi, I’m @jiajiasun
- 👀 I’m interested in geophysical inversion and machine learning with application to 3D Earth model building, mineral resources mapping and groundwater system imaging.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to fly a drone, and how to program in Python, PyTorch and Keras.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on combining drone magnetic and electromagnetic data with other types of geophysical data (e.g., seismic data) for various applications (mineral, groundwater, volcano, etc.).
